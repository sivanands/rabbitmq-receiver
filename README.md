# RabbitMQ-Receiver

RabbitMQ-Receiver is a library that allows the user to read data with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
from [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

## Requirements

This library requires Spark 1.3+, Scala 2.10+, RabbitMQ 3.5+

## Using the library

There are two ways of using RabbitMQ-Receiver library:

The first one is to add the next dependency in your pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.stratio.receiver</groupId>
  <artifactId>rabbitmq</artifactId>
  <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

The other one is to clone the full repository and build the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/Stratio/RabbitMQ-Receiver.git
mvn clean install
```

### Scala API

There are two ways of creating a receiver. Consuming data directly from a RabbitMQ queue or consuming data from a 
RabbitMQ queue through a direct exchange:

```
val receiverStream = RabbitMQUtils.createStreamFromAQueue(sparkStreamingContext, 
                                                          rabbitMQHost, 
                                                          rabbitMQPort, 
                                                          rabbitMQQueueName, 
                                                          storageLevel)
```

```
val receiverStream 
  = RabbitMQUtils.createStreamFromRoutingKeys(sparkStreamingContext, 
                                              rabbitMQHost, 
                                              rabbitMQPort, 
                                              exchangeName,
                                              exchangeType,
                                              durable,
                                              Seq("routingKey1", "routingKey2", ...), 
                                              storageLevel)
```

### Java API

As in the Scala API there are two ways of creating a receiver. Consuming data directly from a RabbitMQ queue or 
consuming data from a RabbitMQ queue through a direct exchange:

```
JavaReceiverInputDStream receiverStream 
  = RabbitMQUtils.createJavaStreamFromAQueue(javaSparkStreamingContext,
                                             rabbitMQHost, 
                                             rabbitMQPort,
                                             rabbitMQQueueName, 
                                             storageLevel);
```

```
JavaReceiverInputDStream receiverStream 
  = RabbitMQUtils.createJavaStreamFromRoutingKeys(javaSparkStreamingContext, 
                                              rabbitMQHost, 
                                              rabbitMQPort, 
                                              exchangeName,
                                              exchangeType,
                                              durable, 
                                              routingKeyList, 
                                              storageLevel)
```
